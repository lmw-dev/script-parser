# Timeout and Performance Optimization Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of timeout and performance optimizations for the ScriptParser AI Coprocessor, addressing task 9 from the end-to-end workflow specification.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Configuration Management (`app/config.py`)

**TimeoutConfig Class:**
- `ASR_TIMEOUT`: 120 seconds for ASR processing
- `LLM_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds for LLM analysis  
- `OSS_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT`: 60 seconds for OSS uploads
- `URL_PARSER_TIMEOUT`: 10 seconds for URL parsing
- `HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: 5 seconds for HTTP connections
- `HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds for HTTP reads
- `HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT`: 10 seconds for HTTP writes
- `HTTP_POOL_TIMEOUT`: 5 seconds for connection pool access
- `TOTAL_PROCESSING_TARGET`: 50 seconds total processing target

**PerformanceConfig Class:**
- HTTP connection pool settings (10 connections, 5 keepalive)
- File processing settings (100MB max file size, 8KB chunks)
- Memory optimization flags (streaming upload enabled)

**MonitoringConfig Class:**
- Performance thresholds for alerting
- Slow request detection (30s threshold)
- ASR slow threshold (90s) and LLM slow threshold (20s)

### 2. HTTP Client Manager (`app/http_client.py`)

**HTTPClientManager Features:**
- Singleton pattern for connection reuse
- Connection pooling with configurable limits
- Timeout configuration per request type
- Automatic connection cleanup on shutdown
- Support for timeout overrides per request

**Key Benefits:**
- Reduces connection overhead through reuse
- Prevents connection leaks
- Optimizes network performance
- Centralized HTTP client configuration

### 3. Service Timeout Integration

**ASR Service (`app/services/asr_service.py`):**
- Added `asyncio.wait_for()` with `ASR_TIMEOUT` for all operations
- Timeout handling for both URL and file transcription workflows
- Proper timeout error messages for debugging

**LLM Service (`app/services/llm_service.py`):**
- Integrated shared HTTP client with connection pooling
- Applied `LLM_TIMEOUT` to all API calls
- Both DeepSeek and Kimi adapters use optimized HTTP client

**OSS Uploader (`app/services/oss_uploader.py`):**
- Added connection and read timeout configuration
- Integrated with performance config for timeout values

### 4. File Processing Memory Optimization (`app/services/file_handler.py`)

**Streaming Upload:**
- Configurable chunk-based file processing (8KB chunks)
- Memory-efficient handling of large files
- File size validation during streaming
- Automatic cleanup on errors

**Memory Management:**
- Configurable maximum file size limits
- Streaming vs. traditional upload modes
- Immediate cleanup of temporary files

### 5. Performance Monitoring (`app/performance_monitoring.py`)

**ProcessingTimeMonitor Class:**
- Real-time checkpoint recording
- Performance target compliance checking
- Automatic slow operation detection
- Comprehensive performance summaries

**Key Features:**
- Tracks processing time against 50-second target
- Records checkpoints for ASR and LLM completion
- Warns when operations exceed thresholds
- Provides detailed timing breakdowns

### 6. Main Application Integration (`app/main.py`)

**WorkflowOrchestrator Enhancements:**
- Integrated ProcessingTimeMonitor for all workflows
- Performance checkpoints at key processing stages
- Target compliance checking and logging
- HTTP client cleanup on application shutdown

**Performance Logging:**
- Detailed performance summaries in logs
- Processing time tracking for all requests
- Checkpoint timing for optimization analysis

## Performance Targets and Monitoring

### Processing Time Targets
- **Total Processing**: ≤ 50 seconds for 1-minute video
- **URL Parsing**: ≤ 2 seconds
- **File Upload**: ≤ 5 seconds  
- **ASR Transcription**: ≤ 30 seconds
- **LLM Analysis**: ≤ 15 seconds
- **Response Assembly**: ≤ 1 second

### Monitoring Features
- Real-time performance tracking
- Automatic threshold alerts
- Detailed timing breakdowns
- Performance compliance reporting

## Testing

### Integration Tests (`app/test_timeout_integration.py`)
- Configuration validation tests
- HTTP client connection pooling tests
- Service timeout integration tests
- Performance monitoring functionality tests
- Memory optimization feature tests

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Timeout configuration validation

## Configuration Options

All timeout and performance settings can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Timeout Settings
ASR_TIMEOUT=120
LLM_TIMEOUT=30
OSS_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT=60
URL_PARSER_TIMEOUT=10
TOTAL_PROCESSING_TARGET=50

# HTTP Settings
HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=5
HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT=30
HTTP_POOL_CONNECTIONS=10
HTTP_MAX_KEEPALIVE_CONNECTIONS=5

# File Processing
MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB
CHUNK_SIZE=8192          # 8KB
ENABLE_STREAMING_UPLOAD=true

# Monitoring
SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD=30
ASR_SLOW_THRESHOLD=90
LLM_SLOW_THRESHOLD=20
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Reliability**: Proper timeout handling prevents hanging requests
2. **Better Performance**: Connection pooling reduces network overhead
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming file processing reduces memory usage
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and alerting
5. **Scalability**: Configurable limits and connection management
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration and monitoring

## Requirements Satisfied
