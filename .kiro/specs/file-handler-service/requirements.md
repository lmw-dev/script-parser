# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a temporary file handling service for the coprocessor application. The FileHandler service provides secure file upload processing, temporary storage management, and cleanup functionality. It serves as a bridge between FastAPI's UploadFile objects and downstream ASR services that require file paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FileHandler service that can securely save uploaded files to temporary storage, so that downstream services can process them safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FileHandler.save_upload_file() receives an UploadFile object THEN the system SHALL save it to a temporary directory with a unique filename
2. WHEN saving files THEN the system SHALL use aiofiles for async I/O operations to avoid blocking the event loop
3. WHEN generating filenames THEN the system SHALL use UUID to ensure uniqueness and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN processing user filenames THEN the system SHALL use secure_filename to prevent path traversal attacks
5. WHEN file saving succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a TempFileInfo object with file path, original filename, and size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the file handler to sanitize filenames and prevent security vulnerabilities, so that the system is protected from malicious uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing uploaded filenames THEN the system SHALL use werkzeug.utils.secure_filename for sanitization
2. WHEN generating temporary filenames THEN the system SHALL use UUID to ensure uniqueness
3. WHEN creating temporary directories THEN the system SHALL ensure proper permissions and access controls
4. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL prevent directory traversal attacks
5. WHEN validating files THEN the system SHALL check file size and type constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic cleanup of temporary files, so that disk space is managed efficiently and security is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FileHandler.cleanup() is called with a file path THEN the system SHALL remove the temporary file
2. WHEN cleanup operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN API requests complete THEN the system SHALL ensure cleanup is called in finally blocks
4. WHEN temporary directories are created THEN the system SHALL use appropriate permissions
5. WHEN files are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for automatic cleanup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling with clear error messages, so that I can debug issues and handle failures appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file I/O operations fail THEN the system SHALL raise FileHandlerError with descriptive messages
2. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error descriptions
3. WHEN disk space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. WHEN invalid files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error responses
5. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL include context about the failure cause

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the file handler, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for successful file saving with mocked I/O
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for filename sanitization
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for file cleanup operations
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for I/O error handling
5. WHEN all tests run THEN they SHALL achieve 100% pass rate without real disk I/O

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API user, I want the file handler integrated into the /api/parse endpoint, so that I can upload files for processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the /api/parse endpoint receives file uploads THEN it SHALL use FileHandler to save files temporarily
2. WHEN file processing completes THEN the endpoint SHALL call cleanup in finally blocks
3. WHEN FileHandlerError occurs THEN the endpoint SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes
4. WHEN files are saved successfully THEN the file path SHALL be available for downstream processing
5. WHEN the integration is complete THEN existing API functionality SHALL remain unchanged
