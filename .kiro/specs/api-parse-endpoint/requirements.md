# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a basic skeleton for the `/api/parse` endpoint in the FastAPI coprocessor application. The endpoint must support dual input modes - both JSON requests with URLs and multipart form data with file uploads. This is a foundational component for video parsing functionality that will be extended in future iterations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to send video URLs via JSON POST requests to the /api/parse endpoint, so that I can initiate video processing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to /api/parse with Content-Type application/json AND includes a valid URL in the request body THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with a success response
2. WHEN the JSON request contains a valid URL THEN the system SHALL return a VideoParseResponse with success=true and mock transcript data
3. IF the JSON request is malformed or missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return a 422 status code (Unprocessable Entity)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to upload video files via multipart form data to the /api/parse endpoint, so that I can process local video files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to /api/parse with Content-Type multipart/form-data AND includes a file upload THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with a success response
2. WHEN the multipart request contains a valid file THEN the system SHALL return a VideoParseResponse with success=true and mock transcript data including the filename
3. WHEN the file upload is successful THEN the system SHALL process the file parameter correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive consistent error responses when requests are invalid, so that I can handle errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to /api/parse without either URL or file parameters THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code (Bad Request)
2. WHEN the request fails validation THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate HTTP error status
3. WHEN Content-Type doesn't match the request format THEN the system SHALL return a 422 status code for validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the endpoint, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests covering successful URL requests
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests covering successful file upload requests  
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests covering error cases for missing inputs
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL have integration tests covering Content-Type mismatch scenarios
5. WHEN all tests run THEN they SHALL achieve 100% pass rate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the endpoint to follow established API design patterns, so that it integrates consistently with the overall application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the endpoint is implemented THEN it SHALL use Pydantic models for request and response validation
2. WHEN responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow the VideoParseResponse structure defined in the battle plan
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL include the python-multipart dependency for form data handling
4. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices and pass linting checks
